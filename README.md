# React-portfolio

## Commands:

* `npm run dev` to run locally
* push to `next` branch to deploy to vercel

## Reminder:
- add rel="noopener noreferrer" in all external links (see: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-html-to-open-link-in-new-tab/)

## Task List:
- drugproject: MOVE SITE FROM HEROKU TO VERCEL and put link back in!
- check for unused css
- add MUI (material UI) icon
- add simpleicons locally (forthebadge) if possible to add forthebadge as well

- for cards: 
    - make the header clickable as well
    - put a horizontal line that seperates the links/icons from the rest of the text
    - make smaller spacing between icons
    - make the pics the same size

- look into [deadfile](https://m-izadmehr.github.io/deadfile/#/)
- also look into `service worker` at the end of `index.js` 
- [ ] make icons on simpleicons for ros and gazebo to put in "toolkit"
- maybe button to select projects which fall into: web dev, data science, DE etc.
- add projects:
    - icons for simpleicons and ion icons. Wait until doing both and make single card in collaborative projects
    - CNC router project
    - This website
    - PresstaMFG
- [ ] update projects:
    - For the drone project put stuff about control systems in description and start being sure to align keywords in the project descriptions more. Also add a link to one of the youtube videos.
    - For the drone and FSAE cars put in a grabcad link. Make the chrome icon for now if not available but make a grabcad icon for sure. It's not in IonIcons but looks open source and can contribute
    - For the subaru project put in a picture of the actual engine, maybe the drivetrain laid out on the table at work.
- [ ] make a set of colored buttons which let you toggle between "all", "electromechanical engineering", and "Data science" categories
- [ ] in the toolkit maybe add a section for engineering and a section for project management
- [ ] in project info/portfolio code change "projecttools" to "pythontools" and create a category for more generic/soft skills
- [ ] see if the entire box can be made to zoom when hovering over, not just the picture. related to modal
- [ ] add soft skills where relevant. Maybe resource planning, conflict mediation, training etc.
- [ ] remove the "impacts" section from the drone paper, reread the rest and make sure to update the TOC
- maybe add a picture or keep the picture in the popup. Something where it's just the box that zooms/rearranges instead of a seperate window would be slick. for now take the first picture that's in the preview and figure out a gallery style way of viewing the pictures.
    - Add pictures from the portolio folder on my windows laptop so there's some sort of scrolling images for the car popups. Also add the connecting rod 1 and 2 pictures. Should probably be converted to step, run FEA on it to do a buckling analysis and done as a 4 pane pic(1,2,FEA1,FEA2)
    - Add flow sim youtube link to FSAE description
- [ ] Add a preview picture that shows up when sending links to the site (verify with linkedin profile)

## Maybe List:

- Update RL logo to site caliper/code logo (MAYBE swap both)
- adding a less obtrusive modal for the popups in portfolio
- create a website for the zooplankton project which operates in real time?
- put the logic diagrams from the github projects on the pages for project descriptions. Maybe also just completely copy the github descriptions to flesh them out a bit
